    <h1>My dog, Vader, was a badass!</h1>
    <p>Here are some of my favorite things about him:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>He loved people more than food</li>
      <li>He rarely barked</li>
      <li>He looked cool!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If I ever get another dog, I would probably get another black lab</p>
    <p>Just like Vader!</p>
